# turtle_circles
Just a test project using turtle.py. The code isn't very opitimized, there are probably better ways to do this.

Description:
Makes a circle, then creates a bigger circle outside of the last circle.


Bugs:
- When starting the program, the turtle does multiple spins before actually drawing
- Can get laggy
- Not a bug, but the comments are very confusing (will fix later)
